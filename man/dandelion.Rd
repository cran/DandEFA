Dandelion Plot 
}
\description{
Creating a Dandelion plot for R-mode Exploratory Factor Analysis methods. Loadings matrix and Factor variances are being visualized.
} 
\usage{ 
dandelion(fact_load, bound = 0.5, mcex=c(1,1), palet)
}
\arguments{
  \item{fact_load}{A "loadings" class object. Factor loading matrix. 
}
  \item{bound}{
Minimum loadings to visualize. Value should be between 0 and 1. For example, bound=0.5 will only visualize loadings more than 0.5.
 }
  \item{mcex}{
A vector with two points. First element determines the size of labels within dandelion plot, and second element determines the size of labels within uniquenesses and communalities graphs
 }
  \item{palet}{
A vector of colors. The first and the last elements of the vector are the colors of positive and negative loadings
 }
}
\details{
A Dandelion Plot visualizes both factor variances and loadings in the same time. Each central line represents a different factor and is connected to a star graph. These star graphs visualize the factor loadings for the corresponding factor. Negative and positive loadings are indicated by red and blue regions, respectively. Explained variance of each factor can be observed by the size of each star graph or by the angle between the consecutive central lines. For example, explained variance of first factor is determined by the angle between the first and second central line. 
Communalities and uniquenesses are also given on the right hand side along with a list of factor variances and explanation ratios.
